                PUNotes began as a simple idea among a group of Pokhara University students who 
                noticed a common challenge: accessing quality study materials was often difficult 
                and time-consuming. Students were spending countless hours searching for notes, 
                previous year questions, and reliable study resources.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Recognizing that many students had excellent notes and materials but no easy way 
                to share them, we decided to create a platform that would benefit the entire PU 
                community. What started as a small initiative has now grown into a comprehensive 
                resource hub used by hundreds of students across different programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, PUNotes continues to evolve, driven by student feedback and the shared 
                vision of making quality education accessible to all. We're proud to be a 
                student-led initiative that puts the community first.
